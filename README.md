## Project Description

We are creating an open-source project with the purpose to help people with social anxiety. Many people could benefit from this project.


The purpose of the project is to build a cross-platform app (mainly iOS and Android). The app would show the users social challenges for them to do which helps with their social anxiety or any related anxiety disorders.

It is also possible for the user to choose a specific area where he/she wants to focus on such as public speaking and the app would show challenges that would help in that specific regard only.

## Technologies being used

- Material UI
- Flutter
- Firebase

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Download and install any IDE that supports Flutter or the Dart Language
- Download and install the latest version of the Flutter Framework. See https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install
- Download and install the latest version of Git on your system. See https://git-scm.com/downloads.
    - To make sure if your Git is on the latest version, run this command on the command line: `git -v`.
- Download and install the latest version of NodeJS and npm on your system. See https://nodejs.org/en/.
    - npm is included with the NodeJS installation. This means that you only have to download and run the NodeJS installer.
    - To make sure if your NodeJS is on the latest version, run this command on the command line: `node -v`.
    - To make sure if your npm is on the latest version, run this command on the command line: `npm -v`.

If you prefer the command line way of downloading and installing things, then feel free to do so. Otherwise, the instructions above should get you up and running.

### How to run

- Clone the repository for this project by running the following command in the terminal of your IDE: 'git clone https://github.com/markhallak/AnxietyGo.git'.


##### `flutter pub get`

- It gets all the dependencies listed in the pubspec.yaml file in the current working directory, as well as their transitive dependencies.

`Optional`
##### `flutter pub upgrade`

- It gets the latest versions of all dependencies used by the app.
